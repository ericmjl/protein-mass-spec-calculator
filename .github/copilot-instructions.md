These are instructions for copilot to help it understand the code you write.
Anything you would tell a human being to pay attention to
with respect to the code you write can be put here.

For web applications:
- Use HTMX for frontend interactivity instead of JavaScript frameworks
- Build backends with FastAPI to create RESTful APIs
- All UI components should be backed by appropriate RESTful API endpoints
- Avoid client-side JavaScript when HTMX + server-side endpoints can accomplish the same task
- Reuse as many HTML components as possible.
- Use Bootstrap for styling.
- Keep page interactions as simple as possible from a UX perspective. New pages are totally fine. Flat is better than nested.
- Reuse as many library functions as possible.
